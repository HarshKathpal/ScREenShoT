# ScREenShoT

This is GUI application to take screenshot. When we run .exe file, it will create a ScreenShot folder on the location where we executed the program and show 2 buttons in the right corner of the screen. One is "SS" to take Screenshot and another is for Exit.

If anyone wants .exe file then send me a mail on kathpalharsh@gmail.com. I will send it to you.
